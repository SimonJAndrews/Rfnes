This is a website I am building and maintaining which is for English Speakers who are learning Russian Language. I enjoy learning the Russian language however there are some very stark differences between Russian and Englishe which means learning it can be overwhelming at the beginning. Through the exercises on this site; a person can start to get a basic grasp of some of the most common grammar patterns used in the Russian language and as such progress quicker. It prevents a person falling into the trap of trying to take russian words and construct sentences as English people do. 

Of course the site will cover the very basics however the main aim of the site is to give native English speakers some insight from my own experience of Learning Russian. I also have the help of Native Russian speakers which is indespensible in ensuring the authenticity of the material on the site. 

I hope you find this site useful. For me it is an exercise in both web developement and in making something that will hopefully attrace real world users.

One of the main benefits of this site is that I intend to add more and more to the site in terms of complexcity using JavaScript as I myself progress learning the language. 

I hope you enjoy this site when its up and running. Thankyou.
