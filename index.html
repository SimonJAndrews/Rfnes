                <h2>Welcome</h2>
                <p>If you are an English speaker and beginning to learn Russian or you have already started but need a
                     little help along the way, this site is designed with a number of exercises based on everyday Russian 
                     grammar patterns which will help to get you speaking quicker.

                </p>
                <p>You may read on the internet and watch YouTube language channels which tell you to ignore grammar. While Russian grammar may be difficult, 
                    it is indispensable within the language. Russian cases demand that you use the correct endings in order to identify the direct object, 
                    the recipient, or show possession, etc. While this may seem daunting, if you spend some time doing the exercises on this site, 
                    you will become familiar with the most common grammar patterns. Patterns that you will hear native Russian speakers use in everyday life or on YouTube. 
                </p>
                <p>Further to this, I have made this site because I understand what its like when you first start.
                    All i would say to this is -  the answer is concentrated study and incremental time. Exposure to the language and most importantly - <strong>Practice speaking.</strong> </p>

                <p>If you havent already done so, find a language partner. Someone who is ready to engage with you at the level you are at. Take time to find the right person. There are many people out there but not all are suitable language exchange partners.
                    When you do find a good exchange partner you will see the progression fast. Lastly, dont be afraid to make mistakes. It's a necessity in learning.You need to make them over and over again in order to learn. 

                <p> I hope you find this site useful. If you have any suggestions for improvement please contact me on the contact page. i will be glad to hear from you.</p>
